    <p id="about_paragraph" >Michael is a rising junior at Texas A&M University, currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2024. Born in Round Rock, Texas, Michael sees his purpose as to make an impact on the world around him. Starting in Round Rock High School, he gradually became more involved with service efforts in his community, while simultaneously building his coding knowledge. By the end of his time there, he would be a capable programmer in Java, completed multiple college level courses like calc 1 and 2, as well as build over 100 hours of community service. By the time he got to A&M, he would continue his efforts the best he could. Deciding to focus all his efforts toward becoming a programmer and certified cyber-security specialist, Michael would participate in programs that would help him develop his skills. Currently, Michael is a member of Engineering Honors, having spent the first year in the honors dorm and undergone development of future additional projects. Engineering honors values excellence above all else, and Michael certainly has proven to be an exemplary member of the program. In the first half of his sophomore year, Michael would help co-found QuantA&M, Texas A&Mâ€™s first quantum computing organization, dedicated to helping connect students with resources they need to learn more about the subject. As of his junior year, Michael has become proficient in multiple computer languages, participated in two study abroad experiences, and became a valued member of student led organizations on campus. Michael has a strong passion for music, literature, movies, art, and video games, and frequently uses his free time to expand his ability to interpret and create. He loves spending time in Austin with his friends, visiting his favorite shops, favorite restaurants, going on hikes, and swimming around town. Michael is very excited to see what the next few years bring, with new experiences and developing old skills alike.</p>
