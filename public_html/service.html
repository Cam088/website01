    <p id="about_paragraph" >Michael is dedicated to the improvement of his community. Since high school, he has been collecting over 100 hours of community service, mainly through the Round Rock Serving Center. Here, michael was mainly involved with the food pantry, completing tasks dealing with organization and collection of donated goods. Additionally, he became involved in "Texas Humane Heroes," an animal shelter operating out of Leander. Michael has always been fond of animals, so the difference he makes here has become the most important for him. Any way in which he can help make their lives easier, and hopefully improve their chances of adoption, is where he plans to make the most difference.</p>
